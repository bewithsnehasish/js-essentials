# Chai aur Code - 30 Days JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to the "Chai aur Code - 30 Days JavaScript Challenge" repository. This repository contains the daily assignments and solutions for the 30-day JavaScript challenge led by Hitesh Choudhary.

## Overview

This challenge aims to teach JavaScript fundamentals and advanced concepts through daily assignments. Each day, a new task or set of tasks is provided, which are to be solved and documented in this repository.

## Usage

Each day contains a folder with the corresponding date and assignment files. You can run the JavaScript files using Node.js or by including them in an HTML file and opening it in a browser.

## Daily Assignments

### Day 1: Variables and Data Types

- Task 1: Declare a variable using `var`, assign it a number, and log the value to the console.
- Task 2: Declare a variable using `let`, assign it a string, and log the value to the console.
- Task 3: Declare a variable using `const`, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console.
- Task 4: Create variables of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the `typeof` operator.
- Task 5: Declare a variable using `let`, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.
- Task 6: Try reassigning a variable declared with `const` and observe the error.
